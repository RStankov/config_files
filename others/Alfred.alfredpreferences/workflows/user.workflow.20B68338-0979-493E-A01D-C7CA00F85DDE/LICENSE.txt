The icon is from ~MazeNL77's "nx10" icon set.

The sound is "Ice" from Nitram+Nunca's awesome "Minutes" dashboard widget.
Sadly, the company seems to have vanished. I love this sound and use
it on all my devices as an alarm sound. So Nitram+Nunca, I hope it is okay
for you that I include your sound file. If not please contact me and I will
take it offline.

The rest of the project is released under the MIT license.
