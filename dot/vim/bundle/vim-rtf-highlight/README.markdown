This plugin is used to syntax highlight pieces of code to RTF and it automatically copies it to the OSX clipboard. This was basically done to scratch an itch while building my keynote presentations. I haven't tested this on linux but you can probably use [xsel](http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/) for the same.

This plugin is is basically a wraper around [highlight](http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight.html). Hope you like it. 

To highlight a file, simply use

    :RTFHighlight <lang>

It also works on visual selections.
