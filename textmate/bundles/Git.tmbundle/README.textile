h1. The Git Textmate Bundle.

Release 1.8.0 [2009-07-31]

"James Conroy-Finn":http://github.com/jcf is the new maintainer of this bundle. If you have cloned the bundle from Tim Harper's repository, please update your git config settings to point to his repository:

<pre>
  cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/Git.tmbundle
  git config remote.origin.url git://github.com/jcf/git-tmbundle.git
</pre>

Thanks -- the management

h2. Installation

<pre>
  mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
  cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
  git clone git://github.com/jcf/git-tmbundle.git Git.tmbundle
</pre>

* In the TextMate preferences, advanced tab, shell variables, set the TM_GIT variable to point to your installation of git (ie <code>/usr/local/bin/git</code>)
* Many shortcuts are available from the Git-shortcut (Ctrl-Shift-G).  Subversion commands are Command-Option-g.  Less frequent commands are accessed via the menu.
* Update your bundle by running the "Update Git Bundle" command.

h2. Support

* "Issue tracker":http://github.com/jcf/git-tmbundle/issues
* "Repository":http://github.com/jcf/git-tmbundle

The "Mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/git-tmbundle has now been closed. Please feel free to report issues using the "Issue tracker":http://github.com/jcf/git-tmbundle/issues.

h2. Theme notes:

The "Git Commit Message" Language defines two scopes that can be used by a theme to generate "line too long" warnings for the first line of the commit:

* invalid.warning.line-too-long.git-commit
* invalid.error.line-too-long.git-commit

The warning scope triggers when the first line exceeds 50 characters; the error scope over 65 characters. These aren't generally-used TextMate scopes, so you can add new rules to your preferred themes, such as orange background/red background. You can also edit the regex to change the preferred character counts.
