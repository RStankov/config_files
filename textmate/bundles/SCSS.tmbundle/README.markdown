This is a TextMate Bundle for [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). 

This bundle contains the grammar files for highlighting the NEW SYNTAX; the old syntax is not supported by this bundle. Sorry.

It also includes Zen CSS ( from the Zen Coding Project ); which will help you speed up your coding.

# New Feature: XHTML to SCSS Converter
You can see the new feature in action in [this screencast](http://screenr.com/TZ0). Sorry for my engrish.. I need to practice more heh.

Notes about this feature:

Yo shouldn't use this feature to convert the whole XHTML to SCSS. It is meant to selectively copy and paste your XHTML to SCSS Document. In the Screencast I did a complete layout parse for the sake of demonstration. However this is a bad practice since it generates unnecessary nesting and of course bloat.

# New Feature: XHTML to SCSS Converter now uses style declarations!

See it in action! [Screencast](http://screenr.com/fP4).

#### The minimum requirements for this command to work:

- [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/)
- Ruby 1.8.7 or higher (it comes by default with Snow Leopard)
- Mac OS X (No support for Windows yet. I didn't implement the clipboard method for it.)

## Installation
### Textmate (OS X)
#### With Git:

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    git clone git://github.com/kuroir/SCSS.tmbundle.git "SCSS.tmbundle"
    gem install nokogiri
    osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'

#### Without Git:

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    wget http://github.com/kuroir/SCSS.tmbundle/tarball/master
    tar zxf kuroir-SCSS.tmbundle-*.tar.gz
    rm kuroir-SCSS.tmbundle-*.tar.gz
    mv kuroir-SCSS.tmbundle* "SCSS.tmbundle"
    gem install nokogiri
    osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'


## Before Forking

If you want your patches merged to the main branch, **please** do the following:

1. If you're going to modify the Grammar, **first** edit the documented & commented "source" located in `SCSS.tmbundle / Syntaxes / source.textmate`. **then** apply it to Textmate. The reason behind this is that Textmate removes comments and indentations, making the grammar file hard to work on.
2. PULL REQUEST, so I know you want me to pull!

#### Known Issues:

- Error Highlighting sometimes fails, will need to improve the regexp.

Thanks to [Chris Eppstein](http://github.com/chriseppstein) who developed the base SCSS.tmbundle.

This bundle has the Zen Coding Bundled within because of the scope. You can view the repository here: [Zen Coding @ google.com](http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/).
