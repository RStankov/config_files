[{"	name"untitled__.txt"content"—I have done some research on Facebook's APIs. This is what I found related to "better invitation tool":

Facebook has FQL API ( http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/ ), from which we can search for users/friends and so.
The only limitation there are the Facebook Privacy Setting and if certain user didn't authorize us to access his data, we can't access it.
Since out target are users who are not yet connected to Garmz.com, we can only access this information about them:

uid
first_name
middle_name
last_name
name
locale
current_location
affiliations (regional type only)
pic_square
profile_url
sex

http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/rest/users.getInfo/

For posting on someone's wall there is Facebook's Graph API ( http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/  ) and the Post object ( http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/post/ ). With those we can post a wall post + link. 
But we will need to require "publish_stream" permissions from a user to post message though him.

What we can do for example is to:
  Select 5 random female friends of the current user, who are not connected to Garmz.com and take uid, names, picture, profile_url from them via FQL
  Display those 5 users with custom made invitation UI.
  When the current user want's to share the page with a friend, he fill some textarea and then we post this message + link to the page on his friend's wall via Graph API.
